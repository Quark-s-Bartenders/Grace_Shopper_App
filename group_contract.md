# GROUP CONTRACT

## Roles

### Taskmaster

- Keeps track of todos/issues.
- Assigns pairs/tasks each day
- Facilitate communication and minimize double work.
- Make sure everyboyd knows what everybody else is doing

### Gitmaster

- Makes sure people are commiting responsibly
- Makes sure branches are accurate and people are making pull requests
- Makes sure people are reviewing pull requests

### Testmaster

- Makes sure tests are being written
- Adds tests where needed
- Makes sure tests are passing and if not, discussing with team or whoever created feature
- Ensure members write a max of 1-3 tests per feature, covering the base case and any potential edge cases

### Daily process

- Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
- New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
- Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master (can do on the fly over the course of the day)

### Team expectations

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- debate infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on

### Issues

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
- Take 10-15 minute break
- List out the pros / cons
- Vote on it (last case scenario)
- If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
- If you are frustrated
- Take a walk or get some water
- Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
- Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated

### Best Practices

- Clear comments, particulary for complicated algos/code
- Assume Hooks for React Components (can revisit if necessecary)
